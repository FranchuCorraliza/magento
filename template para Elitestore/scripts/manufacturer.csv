ALEXANDER MCQUEEN,Alexander McQueen,alexander_mcqueen-cabecera.jpg,"What is the first thing that pops into your mind when hearing Alexander McQueen? The dramatic, methodically cut silhouettes and impeccable tailoring? Or the signature patterns and motifs? Perhaps it’s tartan – a tribute to the late designer's Scottish roots. Or maybe the ominpresent skulls, featured everywhere from t-shirts, to shoes, including Oversized Sneakers, to accessories and bags: the edgy Knuckle Box Clutch and Padlock Bag, the elegant Insignia Satchel, the structured Legend Bag, or Heroine, with its timeless sleek lines. ",,,,0,1,0,,,Alexander McQueen,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,THE FASHION HOUSE,"Alexander McQueen founded his brand in 1992. From being the apprentice of tailoring masters, and later on, chief designer for Givenchy, the notoriously known as the “hooligan” of British fashion stood out for combining sharp technique with striking catwalk shows. After his death, Sarah Burton, McQueen's former right hand, took over as creative director, maintaining the  spirit of the house alive, with a softer, more feminine touch. Burton is already known for designing Catherine Middlenton's, Duchess of Cambridge wedding dress, and for being one of the most influecial people in the fashion industry. ",THE NEW SEASON,"Inspired in McQueen's obsession for symbolism, FW16 collection is presented  as a vision of romanticism clashing into modernity, incorporating talisman motifs into patterns and prints for both genders. Womenswear, inspired in dreams and femininity, brings delicate, artisanally worked pieces, and impeccable tailoring. Menswear offers a stunning merge between sober lines and neoteric details.

ACYNETIC ,,acynetic-cabecera.jpg,,,,,0,1,0,,,Acynetic,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Acynetic was launched in 2015 in Paris, by Adriano Goldschmied, known as “the Godfather of Denim” for his extensive background working with Diesel and Replay, among others, and Italian entrepreneur Marco Doro. Their vision was to create a sophisticated knit line that looks like denim, and has the comfort and performance of sportswear. An innovative take on knitting technique, using circular machines and an indigo yarn combined with high-performance Spandex, offers a new version of multi-directional stretch fabric and “comfort without comparison to the old generations of denim”. Covering a range that goes from tops to bottoms and outwear, the brand's versatile collections are inspired by sunny California. Acynetic is an array of ultra modern everyday essentials that fuse sportswear and the cutting-edge fashion and definitely a brand to keep an eye on! Available only in a handful of handpicked top designer concept stores worldwide. And we are proud to be one of them.",,,,,acynetic-logo.jpg,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
